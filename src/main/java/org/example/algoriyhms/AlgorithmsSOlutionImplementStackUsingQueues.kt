}

//Approach
//PUSH opeartion:
//
//We have taken 2 queues.
//we are checking until and unless the queue1 is not empty, remove the elemnt from the front of the queue1 and add it into queue2.
//then add the new element into the queue1.(AACHA,YOU CAN THINK THE QUEUE 1 AS A STACK, MEANS THE FINAL ANSWER WE WILL GET FROM IT, AND QUEUE2 IS JUST A HELPING QUEUE TO STORE THE ELEMENTS AT SOME POINT OF TIME.** BECHARA QUEUE2.** )
//Then again we will run a loop util and unless the queue2 is empty,and add the elements in queue1 by removing it from queue2.
//HMM!! WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM
//You people are smart enough to understand the peek(),top(), and empty() methods, so not explaining those(By looking at the code we can understand ,just using built in functions).
//Complexity
//Time complexity:
//
//according to leetcode time complexcity is O(N).


//Implement Stack using Queues
//
//Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).
//
//Implement the MyStack class:
//
//void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
//int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
//int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
//boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
//Notes:
//
//You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
//Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input
//["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
//[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
//Output
//[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]
//
//Explanation
//MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
//myStack.push(1);
//myStack.push(2);
//myStack.top(); // return 2
//myStack.pop(); // return 2
//myStack.empty(); // return False
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= x <= 9
//At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
//All the calls to pop and top are valid.

//Approach
//Explanation:
//Base Case: If the root is null (empty tree), thereâ€™s nothing to invert, so return null.
//Swap Children:
//
//TreeNode temp = root.left;
//// Store the left child in a temporary variable.
//root.left = root.right;
//// Make the right child the new left child.
//root.right = temp;
////  Make the original left child (now stored in temp) the new right child.
//Recursive Calls:
//invertTree(root.left);
//// Recursively call invertTree to invert the left subtree.
//invertTree(root.right);
//Recursively call invertTree to invert the right subtree.
//Return Root:
//After the left and right subtrees are inverted, return the modified root. The original tree is now inverted.
